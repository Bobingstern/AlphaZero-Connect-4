# AlphaZero-Connect-4
AlphaZero model to play connect4

Currently `c4_modelFPU2` is the best model and is able to beat all the other versions. It's close to perfect but not quite there and is still tough to beat. [Training Repo](https://github.com/kevaday/alphazero-general)

Player against it [here](https://bobingstern.github.io/AlphaZero-Connect-4/js/)

The js deployment is a little buggy so make sure you click the correct box and wait for the ai to make a move before clicking
